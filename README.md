# Mplab-space-work

This README is designed to guide users in practicing with MPLAB IDE and primarily focuses on implementing PID control for a motor equipped with a quadrature encoder with a pic16.The project aims to practically understand how to apply PID algorithms to manage the speed and position of motors, a fundamental skill in robotics and automation. Using MPLAB IDE, users will learn how to efficiently configure, develop, and debug applications for microcontrollers. The quadrature encoder, essential for providing information on the position and speed of the motor, allows precise control mechanisms to be implemented. Through this project, users will gain hands-on experience in embedded system design, PID control theory, and the application of these concepts using MPLAB IDE.
